# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-NIDS-using-ML
A machine learning-based system designed to detect and prevent network intrusions. This project leverages various algorithms to identify and mitigate potential threats in real-time, enhancing network security.
Monitor a network or system for malicious activity and protects a computer network from unauthorized access from users, including perhaps insider.
The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between ‘bad connections’ (intrusion/attacks) and a ‘good (normal/benign) connections’.
